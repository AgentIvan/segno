Welcome to Segno's documentation!
=================================

Segno generates QR Codes and Micro QR Codes according to ``ISO/IEC 18004:2015(E)``.
Aside from other Pyhton QR Code generators, Segno has no 3rd party dependencies
and is very simple to use.

If you know the (great) API of Michael Nooner's `PyQRCode`_ library, you'll
discover some similarities since this project started accidentally as an
improvment of PyQRCode, even if this project is not a fork of it.
