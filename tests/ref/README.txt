This directory contains QR Codes (matrices, only) created by other services
(like Google Chart API) which serve as reference images.

    0 = white module
    1 = dark module

Example finder pattern:

    1111111
    1000001
    1011101
    1011101
    1011101
    1000001
    1111111

No border / quiet zone should be defined, just the pure matrix.
